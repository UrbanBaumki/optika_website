# Optika website
This was a project i made 2 years ago without the help of librarys such as angular or node, so it was made entirely from scratch.
The only thing i needed for smooth animations was the jquery library and thats it.
Website was made as a store preview with CMS capabilities that were also programmed by me, using ajax request and php integration and a MYSQL database running.
